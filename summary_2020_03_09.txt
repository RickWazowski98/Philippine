To summarize, what I should do:
- scale script to scrape 18 websites (start just with Thailand condominiums tab first);
- change the order of output; set output data to 18 tabs (later); 
- add as notes to the column headers the filters that script uses (it uses filters which you text me during previous iterations);
- add rotating fake User-agents with proxies to hide suspicious activity for website's owner;
- speed: script should scrape everything during 8 hours timeframe.

Right?
